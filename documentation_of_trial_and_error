Niels:

First attempt:
    Method:
        Multi logistic regression model with manual feature selection.
        Training data points were entire images
        Feature matrix compression was required using a PCA to avoid mem alloc errors
        Used the entire training set for training -> no possibility of evaluating model performance
        Not really used regularization
    Conclusions:
        Results on training data comparable to KNN
        Results on test data incredibly poor / unrecognizable
        Model overfitted massively
    For the next approach (after informing a bit more about image segmentation:)
        - Use Aggressive Data Augmentation (virtually get more training data at runtime by visually manipulating images)
        - Use a (lightweight / not too deep) CNN
        - Better validation / model evaluation by splitting test
        - Split labelled data into training + validation set
        - Use proper regularization

Second attempt: #TO DO
